# Intersubject correlation analysis for BIDS data

This tool is a BIDS App for running intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis on
BIDS-formatted data. Subjects must be normalized to a template space prior to
ISC analysis. This tool is generally designed for data preprocessed using
fMRIPrep, but is intended to work with any dataset following the BIDS
derivatives specification.
